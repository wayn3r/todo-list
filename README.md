## Running the app

To run the app we need to first build the apps

### Frontend (Angular app)

-   Move to `/app` directory with `cd ./app`
-   Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed
-   Run `npm run build`

Now, with the frontend built

### Backend (Nest app)

-   Move to `/api` directory with `cd ./api`
-   Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed
-   Run `npm start`

That last commad will build and start the app.

Once finished you will be able to see the app running at `http://localhost:3000`
